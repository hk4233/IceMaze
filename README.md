# Ice Maze

It’s winter in Rochester, and you have been trapped on a frozen pond! You would like to
escape but the ice is slippery so you can only move in a straight line until you run in to a
rock or the edge of the pond. To make things worse, there is only one exit from the pond.
Of course, there are many different ponds out there that you might get trapped in, so you
need a general strategy to escape.


There is one such pond that you might find yourself in, and (on the right) how
you could escape — the darkened squares represent rocks in the pond against which you can
stop, and the gap in the border of the pond is your escape.

Given a pond, the quickest way to escape
the pond from any possible starting location. You must also discover how many places you
could start from where you cannot escape at all!
